# d3.explore

An exploration of d3.js visualizations in the context of MEDEA project.

The goal of d3.explore project is to evaluate the relevance of a selection of
of charts to present a visual answer to a set of questions about the authors
who contributed to the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change][IPCC].

[IPCC]: https://www.ipcc.ch/

## Questions

1. Who are the authors that have participated
   in more than 1, 2, 3, or 4 assessment reports?

2. Who are the authors that have participated
   in more than 1, 2, 3, or 4 assessment reports
   while holding at least 1 of the 3 elected roles in the IPCC
   in each assessment report of participation
   (Coordinating Lead Author, Lead Author, Review Editor)?

3. Who are the authors that have participated
   in more than one working group (what we call bridge authors)?

4. Are there particular chapters of the IPCC
   where these bridge authors tend to aggregate
   (i.e. around particular themes)?

5. What kind of roles do the authors
   who participate in more than one working group occupy?

6. How does the geographic diversity of IPCC authors change over time?
   Is there a rise over time in participation of authors, for example,
   from South America compared to Asia?

7. Are certain types of institutions
   more affiliated with particular countries than others?

8. Which Least Developed Countries are the most present in the IPCC?
   In which working groups?

9. In which chapters do authors from Africa participate in?
   Is there variation between African country participation?

10. What is the ratio of African Coordinating Lead Authors vs Lead Authors
    vs Review Editors vs Contributing Authors?

11. What are the individual trajectories of those authors
    that have participated in over 14 chapters in the IPCC?
    How do these trajectories compare?
    Are there similar trends in terms of roles held;
    country of affiliation; etc?

12. Where are French authors on the IPCC?
    To which chapters do they contribute the most?

13. Which countries have increased their participation in the IPCC
    and which have decreased their participation over time?

14. Which institutions have increased or decreased the most
    in participation over time?

15. What are the differences in diversity (by country and by institution)
    between the working groups?

## About MEDEA Project

Funded by the [ANR][], the Mapping Environmental DEbates on Adaptation (MEDEA)
Project proposes a research programme based on the innovative methodology
of controversy-mapping in order to understand and ultimately improve the way
we publicly discuss climate change adaptation.

[ANR]: http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/project-based-funding-to-advance-french-research/

MEDEA is based on an original disciplinary articulation resulting from
the collaboration of three partners:

* Sciences Po (médialab and IDDRI),
* the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et l'Environnement
* and the ENSADlab of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs.
