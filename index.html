                The Total of Assessment Reports for each authors
                is presented as a bar chart. The chart doubles as
                a filter which allows the selection of a range of
                values by dragging the mouse from left to right
                from the bar for the start value to the bar for
                the end value. The same range of values can also
                be selected by dragging the mouse from right to left
                from the bar for the end value to the bar for the
                start value.

                Initially, the only hint that the bar chart is interactive
                is the shape of the cursor which changes to a cross on hover.
                After starting a selection, a text appears above the chart
                which describes the current range of values, and helps to
                understand and to refine the selection process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once familiar with the way of defining a range of values
                however, it is straightforward to select authors who
                contributed to more than 2, 3, 4 or 5 assessment reports.
                The other charts and the table with the list of authors
                get updated on the fly, as well as the number of authors
                currently selected, displayed on top of the list.
              </p>
              <p>
                The table lists both authors and their collaborations.
                The collaborations are listed as individual records,
                grouped under a header with the name of the author
                and some statistics: total number of contributions,
                of working groups and of assessment reports. Each of
                these values is only displayed when greater than 1,
                which reduces the amount of information displayed
                in the most common cases.
              </p>
              <p>
                The number of records displayed in the table must be limited
                to keep the page responsive. The duration required to refresh
                the table increases exponentially With the number of records,
                freezing the display completely when a large number of authors
                and contributions are selected. This limit can be configured
                through a list: only 10 contributions are displayed initially
                to keep the page responsive while filtering data; the user can
                change this value to display more records or the full list at
                a later point.

                The row chart Cumulated Working Groups partitions authors
                according to the complete set of working groups to which
                they contributed. The rows labeled "WG I", "WG II" and
                "WG III" show the authors who contributed to a single group.
                The remaining rows correspond to the bridge authors which
                contributed to more than one working group: "WG I+II",
                "WG I+III", "WG II+III", "WG I+II+III".

              </p>
              <p>
                Using Cumulated Working Groups avoids the confusion of authors
                that belong to multiple working groups. However, another
                confusion arises: to select all the authors who contributed
                to a working group, 3 different rows must be select; it is
                not enough to select WG I, for example, WG I+II and WG I+II+III
                must be selected as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dynamic range of values introduces another challenge:
                when groups with over 1000 authors are represented on the
                same chart as groups with only 10 or 15 authors, the rows for
                the smallest groups are hardly visible which makes it hard
                to click on the rows to select these groups and to identify
                the current color of these groups to check whether they are
                selected or not. This issue tends to worsen with filters
                applied through different charts, which further reduce the
                number of authors displayed and thus the length of the rows.

                No filter allows to select only bridge authors in version V0

                Cumulated Working Groups. Bridge authors are represented as

                in the row chart "Cumulated Working Groups" as described in

                The depiction of roles on pie charts is misleading: the
                authors who endorse a different role for different
                contributions belong to more than one section.
                While the area of a section is still proportional to the
                percentage of authors with a given role, these percentages
                do not add up to a total of 100%. To provide a more
                accurate representation, the sections should overlap, which
                would still be confusing visually.

                This ratio can be seen in the visualization of authors
                grouped "by Role in each Country Aggregation".
                The group labeled "AG" corresponds to authors affiliated
                with institutions located in a country part of the
                "African Group".

                In this visualization, each role is represented with
                a different color,
                cyan for CLA (Contributing Lead Authors),
                blue for LA (Lead Authors),
                Green for RE (Review Editors),
                red for CA (Contributing Authors),
                while authors with multiple roles are shown in black.

                lists the number of authors for each total number
                of contributions. There is no entry for 14 contributions,
                the next entry, for 15 contributions or more, selects
                only 4 authors.
